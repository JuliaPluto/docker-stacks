# docker-stacks
We provide 3 docker stacks for running pluto!

1. Pluto only in a simple standalone setting
2. Pluto within a very minimal JupyterLab (using the great http-proxy extension, binder compatible)
3. Pluto with CUDA support on


## For running pluto with cuda support please checkout [this README](cuda/README.md).
